spindown
========

Script to monitor harddrives in Linux, and instruct them to spin-down if idle


# To Do:

* Remove hardcoding (paths, raid sets, drives, etc.)
* Identify harddrives in the RAID set automatically
* Store stats data somewhere better (/var/cache maybe?)
* Have the RAID set name passed in by argument
* Reimplement in Python...?
